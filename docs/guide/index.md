# LUYA Principles

::: info LUYA
+ LUYA is **not a one-click** installation product like WordPress and others.
+ **Configuration** data is stored in versioned files (not in the database).
+ We adhere to the **DRY** ("Don't repeat yourself") concept.
+ System code belongs into the **vendor** directory.
